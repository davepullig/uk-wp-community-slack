The WordPress community in the UK is on Slack. 

## What is Slack?
In a nut shell Slack is an online chat service for teams. After many years of IRC, the WordPress.org team moved all of their internal conversations onto Slack. This has made having conversations to do with the WordPress.org project much easier to have regardless of your technical abiity. You can read more about their decision at (chat.wordpress.org)[http://chat.wordpress.org]

## (wp-community-uk.slack.com)[http://wp-community-uk.slack.com] ?
WP Community UK, is the team name for the UK WordPress community. It is currently primarily being used to help support and sustain the many WordPress community organisers up and down the country. This tends to be in the form of discussions around venues, speakers, sponsorship and general running a group discussions.

In the team, you will also find individual channels for all the WordPress groups. In there you will find friendly faces from your local events. The team also enables you to talk with other groups - find out other places to go, other ideas/suggestions for meetings. Plus get involved with the WordCamps and any other WordPress events are are beging organised around the country.

We also use the channel to discuss UK specific issues and ideas. Example topics include our lovely banking system, UK legal and how our lovely government is changing the laws that effects us as freelancers, businesses and employees. 

### What it is not.
(wp-community-uk.slack.com)[http://wp-community-uk.slack.com] is not a WordPress support channel and we are not in favour of siloing ourselves from the greater WordPress community.

This is not to say we don't get questions on issues to do with WordPress, but we highly recommend you visit the WordPress [support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/) or [online chatroom](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wordpress).

## How to get on
1.	First of all, before beginning, you need a WordPress.org account. If you haven't got one, head to https://wordpress.org/support/register.php and sign up for an account.
2.	When this is done, visit https://make.wordpress.org/chat/, and half way down, under the "Joining the WordPress team on Slack", you will find a link to be invited to the Make WordPress Slack channel. Click on "I understand. Please send me an invite." (if you understand all above).
3.	An email will be sent to you. Click that link and then create your account.
4.	You'll be dropped into the Make WordPress Slack channel, it's up to you if you want to join a few more channels (by clicking on the left hand side under "Channels"), but we want to go to the WordCamp Manchester channel, which is hosted on the UK WP Community Slack.
5.	Go to https://wp-community-uk.slack.com/signup, and put in your wordpress.org username in this box. An email will be sent to your email address.
6.	Click on the "Confirm my Email Address", and you'll be taken to another username and password box. This can be the same or different to the username & password to be sent in 4.
7.	You should be taken to the "#general" slack channel. To join the WordCamp Manchester slack channel. Click on the "+X More..." link under "Channels" in the left hand column, and search for "#wordcamp-manchester". Click on the channel's name to preview it, and then click "Join Channel" to join and contribute :)
